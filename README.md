The motivation for this game 
 - The first one is the pixelated t-rex dinosaur game on chrome I used to play all the time when I was young because my desktop computer when I was in Ethiopia didn't have a working network connection so I used to open chrome and play this game all the time. 
 - My biggest motivation for making this game is Karel the robot. Karel is built to perform simple tasks using python and she helped introduce me to programming in python in a fun, practical, and engaging manner. 

This program uses the following
  - tkinter, a library used to create a Graphical User Interface in Python and
  - Pillow, a Python Imaging Library (PIL)
